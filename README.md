# User Authentication in Java

This project demonstrates a user authentication system implemented using Java and Spring Boot.

## Overview

The user authentication system provides the following functionality:

1. **Registration**: Users can register by providing a username and password.
2. **Login**: Registered users can log in by providing their username and password.
3. **JWT-based Authentication**: The system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure and stateless authentication.

The project consists of the following main components:

- `AuthController`: Handles the registration and login API endpoints.
- `AuthService`: Implements the business logic for user registration and login.
- `User`: The entity representing a user.
- `SecurityConfig`: Configures the Spring Security settings, including the JWT authentication filter.
- `JwtService`: Generates and validates JWT tokens.
- `JwtAuthFilter`: A custom Spring Security filter that validates JWT tokens.

## Usage

To use the user authentication system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build and run the application using the following command:
    
    ```
    ./gradlew bootRun
    
    ```
    
3. The application will start running on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Registration

To register a new user, send a POST request to the `/auth/register` endpoint with a `RegisterRequest` in the request body:

```json
{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "password": "password123"
}

```

The server will respond with a `UserDTO` representing the newly registered user.

### Login

To log in, send a POST request to the `/auth/login` endpoint with a `LoginRequest` in the request body:

```json
{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "password": "password123"
}

```

The server will respond with an `AuthResponse` containing a JWT token.

### Authenticated Requests

For subsequent authenticated requests, include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header of the request:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>

```

The `JwtAuthFilter` will validate the token and set the authenticated user in the security context.

## Security Considerations

This example uses a basic JWT-based authentication mechanism. In a production environment, you may want to consider the following security enhancements:

- Secure storage of user passwords (e.g., using a secure hashing algorithm like Argon2)
- Implement password reset functionality with email verification
- Enable multi-factor authentication
- Implement role-based access control
- Use refresh tokens for long-lived sessions
- Integrate with an external identity provider for a more robust authentication solution

## Future Enhancements

Here are some potential enhancements that could be made to this project:

- Implement a separate authentication service or microservice for better scalability and separation of concerns.
- Provide additional user management features, such as account deactivation, email verification, and profile update.
- Integrate with a logging and monitoring system to improve visibility and security auditing.
- Implement rate limiting and other security measures to protect against brute-force attacks and other common security threats.
- Provide a more user-friendly experience, such as a web-based or mobile application for managing user accounts.
